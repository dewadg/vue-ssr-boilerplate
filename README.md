# vue-ssr-boilerplate

I made this Vue.js boilerplate for learning purpose. Currently equipped with:

- Server-Side Rendering (with Fastify as server)
- Cookies injection to server renderer context
- Development server rebuilds on file changes
- Docker ready

## Coding Standard

I use [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com)

## How to use

Development:

```
yarn dev
```

Dev server will rebuild on file changes.

Production:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```
